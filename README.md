I utilized several aspects of JavaScript in order to optimize the functionality of this Tic Tac Toe game. 

I primarily used module pattern to instantiate the game manager and grid while ensuring the CSS animations remain smooth. However, I also made use of factory functions to create the individual boxes within the Tic Tac Toe grid, ensuring to separate private functions from public functions. This taught me the value of hiding certain information from being manipulated unwillingly. During this project, I was also able to visualize the different strategy that functional inheritance uses and how this may be more optimal than regular class-based inheritance as now one can use methods of different objects using the Object.create() method easily.

Overall, this project solidified my understanding of module pattern programming and how private vs. public methods function in JavaScript.
